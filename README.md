# Sadpanda Extension

This is an extension for chrome to take you to a random sadpanda gallery with the press of a button.

### How to Install:

- Download and move the app folder to somewhere
- Go to Chrome - More Tools - Extensions or to chrome://extensions
- If you haven't already enabled Developer Mode in the top right corner, do so
- Click on "Load unpacked extension" in the top left corner and provide the path to where you downloaded it
- If it doesnt show up in your extension bar, click on the puzzle piece, locate the extension in the list and pin it


Please note: You can only roll a random site if youre already on sadpanda, if you click the button on some other page (google or smt), it won't work


In case for some reason there is no window showing when you click on Load unpacked extension, drag the app folder into the window
